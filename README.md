# OBS Shadowplay Replay Simulator
Adds utilities to make OBS's Replay Buffer simulate Shadowplay 

# Features
- Capture replays with a keybind, continuing where you last left off within the replay.
- Displays a toast notifying you of what you just captured.

# Support
Currently only supports Windows architecture. I do not currently have access to Linux or macOS, so I cannot add support. Others are more than welcome to!

# Building
I recommend that you follow the build information provided by the template that this project uses.
